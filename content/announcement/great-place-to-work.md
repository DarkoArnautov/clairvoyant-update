We are proud to announce that Clairvoyant, India, has been certified a Great Place to Work by the Great Place to Work Institute®, for the year August 2019-September 2020. This certification is a result of the five years of hard work and perseverance that we have collectively invested to get to where we are today. A huge thank you to our employees, and clients who have contributed to making this possible.

Our exciting journey in India began in 2014 when two insightful and like-minded individuals came together to create a global technology consulting and services company. They brought with them a set of exceptional values; empowerment, integrity, and transparency being the most important of the lot. It is no surprise that our passionate employee base imbibed these values too which gave way to a fantastic workplace culture that truly sets us apart.

Majorly based on the feedback provided by our employees, this certification served as a yardstick to an array of qualitative metrics including the quality of our HR programs, trust, workplace culture, work-life, etc., It also gave us an honest peek into how our employees view us as an organization.

“Clairvoyant earned the certification based on the many uniquely tailored, people-focused perks and benefits that it continues to bestow upon its employees across all levels”, said Josh Vedam, Director of Growth and Business Operations. “Our flexible work from home policy encourages our employees to spend time with their families and is an indication of our trust in them to be accountable. We motivate them to give their best at work as much as we encourage them to let their hair down.”

Our well-thought-out healthcare plans ensure that our employees and their families are always cared for. In addition to these, we encourage passionate employees to learn and further themselves professionally as we truly believe that in their growth lies our growth.

This certification is not an end but a start to continue our efforts to build an organization that truly supports our employee’s personal and professional development and believes in mutual respect and a performance-based culture.
