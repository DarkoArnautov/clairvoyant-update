### Clairvoyant was featured in the CIO Review Magazines’ 50 most promising IT Services Companies 2015 list.
“Historically, CIOs have been responsible for the IT systems that powers their business’ operations, with the perception that these IT systems are cost-bearing and not necessarily a strategic asset,” notes Pankaj Gaddam, COO, Clairvoyant. “We work with CIOs to challenge this stereotype and help them on their path to transform their IT organization.”
Clairvoyant champions the trend of enabling lean architectures and technologies that can increase business agility—helping them not only achieve their mobile, analytics, and cloud strategy but also adapt to changes in business needs. “We leverage open source technologies, implement data driven philosophies, and strongly adhere to a partnership model to transform IT from within the organization,” 
explains Gaddam.'
