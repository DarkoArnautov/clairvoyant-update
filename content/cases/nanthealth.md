solution = "Clairvoyant analysed the existing infrastructure & process and created a multi-tenant Hadoop based solution. We also created lightweight ingestion solution using Streamsets & Kafka. We transformed the data model from MySQL to HDFS. We used the SolrJ API for indexing data to update Solr indexes for implementing search use cases. We used Spark as a processing engine that would read the data from HDFS / Hive and do the computations. We received multi-level data which was provided as input-feed to Solr Ingest process. All the data was segregated in HDFS by customer for querying. We also implemented the security frameworks through encryption zones by customer."
