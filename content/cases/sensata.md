solution = "Clairvoyant was the system integrator helping roll out the end to end architecture that included Cloudera, Eurotech and Red Hat products. Clairvoyant provisioned and maintained a multi-node Cloudera CDH cluster, which would contain all the ingested data from Sensata’s factory machines. In association with Eurotech, Cloudera and Sensata, we attached IoT edge devices to the factory machines. This would collect all of the produced data and push it into a central Data Hub. From there, we created a Spark Streaming process to ingest all of this production data and store it efficiently into Kudu. Sensata can then use the Cloudera Data Science Workbench, that’s installed and maintained by Clairvoyant, to perform any form of data visualization and Machine Learning."
