about = "Kite Pharma is dedicated to achieving one of the most ambitious goals of 21st century medicine: curing cancer. This mission is at the heart of everything they do, from early research to product development. For the past three decades, members of their team have been at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy. Today, they are a leader in engineered T cell therapy, transforming cancer treatment with what is potentially the biggest breakthrough since the introduction of combination chemotherapy more than 60 years ago. To bring about this transformation, they’re developing innovative products that harness a patient’s own immune system to target and kill cancer cells. Early clinical studies in patients who were treated with engineered T cells have produced dramatic results thus far, up to and including complete remission of cancer in some patients who have aggressive disease and have not responded to other therapies."
