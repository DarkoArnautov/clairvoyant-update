solution = "Clairvoyant developed a solution with an AWS installation and setup a multi node cluster which reduced the data processing time by half. This provided an alternate database storage. We also developed an Ingest Pipeline process for data transfer, data append and data replacement. This workflow was within Apache Airflow to coordinate pipelines. Finally, we developed the Tableau dashboards to access summary data without the use of extracts."
